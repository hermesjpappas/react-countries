# Country Search React App

<img src="countries.png" alt="Preview of the app"/>

This is an app built with React.js and Tailwind CSS which uses the REST Countries API (v3) to display flags and information about different countries.

You can click on any country and see a details page about it. In that page, you can click on its
flag or coat of arms to see a pop-up displaying a larger version of them. From the same details page, you can click
any of the flags of the countries it borders with and go to their details, like a Wikipedia rabbit-hole.

Notes: Should be responsive from any width of 280px and above.
